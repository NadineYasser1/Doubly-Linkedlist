# Doubly-Linkedlist
 DoublyLinkedList
You will implement a Doubly Linked List by:
1-Convert an array to doubly linked list (the resulted linked list should have the same elements in the array with same order)
2-Destroy all elements in the doubly linked list and set head and tail to null in case we printed it should display nothing.
3-Copy all elements in list into a new list and return it without modifying the original list
4-Append list2 at the end of list1 (don’t forget special cases if list1 or list 2 is empty)
5-Return number of elements in the list
6- A checkPalindrome function to Return 1 if elements of list are palindrome and 0 otherwise.
7-Return 1 if the two lists are identical and 0 otherwise.
8-Print list in normal order
9-Print list in reverse order
10-The Input Lists are List1 and List2 will be already sorted,Function should return difference between List1 and List2 which is all elements in List1 that are not in list2
Example:
List 1  2, 4, 8, 9, 13, 17, 20
List 2  2, 8, 17, 20
Result  4,9,13

11-Check if sum of first n/2 elements equals sum of the last n/2 elements. Return 1 if the above check is true and 0 otherwise (in case of odd elements must return 0)
